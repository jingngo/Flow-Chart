# Flow-Chart
I am majoring in Business but get interested in Coding recently. I tried to learn Flow Chart to facilitate my studies - entangled thoughts that should be linked together. I hope for a great journey ahead, changing from using Notion that supports Linear Thinking to Non-linear thinking supporting tools like the Mermaid.
